### How does it work
The old method of copying some simple strings is not useful anymore. **That is because you have only done half.** The game client is also checking for your realm and that is the main reason why you could not load into the game. However, if you simple update your current realm, it should work again.

**Please note that you have to have multiple accounts. This software won't transfer your ships to another server!**
### Alternative solution
[ASLAIN ModPack](http://aslain.com/index.php?/topic/2020-0780-aslains-wows-modpack-installer-wpicture-preview/) has already included this, "*WoWs Realms Tool*".

This is for those who does not want to download 100MB and go through installations just for a simple tool like this.
